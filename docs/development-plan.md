# PersonalEA Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the development plan for the personalEA system, following API-first design principles and industry best practices for microservices development.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: STAGING ENVIRONMENT FOUNDATION**

### **⚠️ MANDATORY READING FOR ALL NEW DEVELOPERS**
Before starting any development work, ALL team members must review and follow the staging environment architecture:

- **📋 [Staging Environment Plan](staging-environment-plan.md)** - Complete architecture overview
- **🚀 [Staging Implementation Roadmap](staging-implementation-roadmap.md)** - Detailed implementation steps

### **Key Requirements:**
- ✅ **Use Staging Environment**: All development MUST use the Docker-based staging environment
- ✅ **Consistent Ports**: API (3000), Frontend (5173), Email (3001), Calendar (3003)
- ✅ **User Testing Milestones**: Test after each service completion
- ✅ **No Ad-hoc Development**: Follow the established staging workflow

### **Current Staging Status:**
- ✅ **Goal Strategy Service**: Working with timeout fixes implemented
- ✅ **Frontend Interface**: React testing UI operational
- 🔄 **Docker Environment**: Ready for implementation (Phase 1)
- 🔄 **Service Integration**: Incremental rollout planned

**🎯 Next Action**: Implement Phase 1 of staging environment before any new feature development.
