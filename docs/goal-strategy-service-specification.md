# Goal & Strategy Service - Technical Specification

## Overview

The Goal & Strategy Service implements a sophisticated 8-step goal-setting and strategic planning workflow that transforms high-level user goals into actionable, scheduled tasks with proper capacity management and dependency tracking.

## 🎯 Core Workflow: 8-Step Goal Management Process

### Step 1: SMART Goal Translation
**Purpose**: Convert vague goals into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound outcomes

#### Input Processing
- **Raw Goal**: User-provided high-level goal (e.g., "Grow revenue")
- **AI Analysis**: GPT-4 powered analysis to identify missing SMART criteria
- **Interactive Clarification**: System queries user for missing specifics

#### SMART Criteria Validation
- **Specific**: Clear, well-defined objective
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable metrics and success criteria
- **Achievable**: Realistic given resources and constraints
- **Relevant**: Aligned with broader business/personal objectives
- **Time-bound**: Clear deadline and timeline

#### Example Transformation
```
Input: "Grow revenue"
Output: "Increase MRR by 15% in Q3 without raising CAC above $150"
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/goals/translate` - Convert raw goal to SMART format
- `POST /api/v1/goals/clarify` - Interactive clarification session
- `GET /api/v1/goals/{id}/smart-analysis` - Get SMART criteria breakdown

---

### Step 2: Critical Success Metric Identification
**Purpose**: Define the single metric that unequivocally indicates goal achievement

#### Metric Selection Process
- **Primary Metric**: The one number that defines success
- **Supporting Metrics**: Secondary indicators that provide context
- **Measurement Framework**: How and when metrics will be tracked
- **Baseline Establishment**: Current state measurement

#### Example
```
Goal: "Increase MRR by 15% in Q3 without raising CAC"
Critical Success Metric: "MRR +15% by Sept 30"
Supporting Metrics: ["CAC ≤ $150", "Churn rate ≤ 5%", "Customer satisfaction ≥ 4.5/5"]
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/goals/{id}/metrics` - Define success metrics
- `GET /api/v1/goals/{id}/metrics/tracking` - Get metric tracking status
- `PUT /api/v1/goals/{id}/metrics/{metric_id}/baseline` - Set baseline values

---

### Step 3: Milestone Breakdown (2-6 per quarter)
**Purpose**: Create measurable "mini-wins" that ladder up to the main goal

#### Milestone Generation
- **AI-Powered Breakdown**: Intelligent milestone suggestion based on goal type
- **Timeline Distribution**: Even distribution across goal timeframe
- **Dependency Awareness**: Logical sequencing of milestones
- **Measurability**: Each milestone has clear completion criteria

#### Milestone Validation
- **Necessity Check**: Each milestone must be essential for goal achievement
- **Sufficiency Check**: All milestones together must be sufficient for goal completion
- **Timeline Feasibility**: Realistic timing given dependencies and resources

#### Example
```
Goal: "Increase MRR by 15% in Q3"
Milestones:
1. "Launch pricing experiment (by Jul 15)"
2. "Close 5 beta customers (by Aug 10)"
3. "Launch paid campaign v1 (by Aug 20)"
4. "Achieve 10% MRR increase (by Sep 15)"
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/goals/{id}/milestones` - Generate milestone breakdown
- `PUT /api/v1/goals/{id}/milestones/{milestone_id}` - Update milestone
- `GET /api/v1/goals/{id}/milestones/progress` - Track milestone progress

---

### Step 4: Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
**Purpose**: Decompose milestones into tasks small enough to complete in ≤1 day

#### Recursive Decomposition
- **Question Framework**: "What has to exist for this to be done?"
- **Task Granularity**: Continue until tasks are ≤8 hours of focused work
- **Completion Criteria**: Clear definition of "done" for each task
- **Resource Assignment**: Identify who will complete each task

#### WBS Hierarchy
```
Milestone: Launch pricing experiment
├── Research & Analysis
│   ├── Analyze competitor pricing (4h)
│   ├── Review customer feedback on pricing (2h)
│   └── Calculate price elasticity (6h)
├── Design & Development
│   ├── Draft 3 price models (4h)
│   ├── Build A/B testing flow in Stripe (8h)
│   ├── QA test checkout process (4h)
│   └── Update landing page copy (3h)
└── Launch Preparation
    ├── Create experiment tracking dashboard (6h)
    ├── Set up analytics events (2h)
    └── Prepare rollback plan (2h)
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/milestones/{id}/wbs` - Generate work breakdown structure
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}` - Update task details
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/subtasks` - Further decompose task
- `GET /api/v1/milestones/{id}/tasks` - Get all tasks for milestone

---

### Step 5: Dependency Mapping & Sequencing
**Purpose**: Identify task dependencies and create optimal execution sequence

#### Dependency Types
- **Finish-to-Start**: Task B cannot start until Task A is complete
- **Start-to-Start**: Task B cannot start until Task A has started
- **Finish-to-Finish**: Task B cannot finish until Task A is complete
- **Start-to-Finish**: Task B cannot finish until Task A has started

#### Sequencing Algorithm
- **Phase 0 Identification**: Tasks with no prerequisites (can start immediately)
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Longest sequence of dependent tasks
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks that can run concurrently
- **Resource Conflicts**: Tasks requiring same person/resource

#### Dependency Visualization
```
Phase 0 (No Prerequisites):
- Analyze competitor pricing
- Review customer feedback

Phase 1 (After Phase 0):
- Calculate price elasticity
- Draft 3 price models

Phase 2 (After Phase 1):
- Build A/B testing flow
- Update landing page copy

Phase 3 (After Phase 2):
- QA test checkout process
- Create tracking dashboard
```

#### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/dependencies` - Add task dependency
